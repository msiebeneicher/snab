  # Which dirs to skip: issues from them won't be reported.
  # Can use regexp here: `generated.*`, regexp is applied on full path.
  # Default value is empty list,
  # but default dirs are skipped independently of this option's value (see skip-dirs-use-default).
  # "/" will be replaced by current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows.
